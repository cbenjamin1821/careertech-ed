This is my dissertation research related to postsecondary education and labor market outcomes for career and technical education high school students.
The data comes from the Dept. of Ed. National Center for Education Statistics-Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS 2002).  The ELS 2002 is complex survey data that uses a two stage stratified sampling methodology.  I am using the balanced repeated replicate (BRR) weighting that involves 200 replicate weight variables due to the fact that I am using the public-use version of the data set.  The key strata variable for calculating standard errors using Taylor Series Linearization is suppressed on the public-use data set; hence, my use of the BRR weighting.
I am using Lumley's Survey Package in R for my analyses and I have managed to match the published standard errors of the ELS 2002 data set, which ensures that my specifications of the BRR weights in my svyrepdesign object are accurate.
I am new to R as well as a novice analyst, so I am seeking all of the guidance I can get!
